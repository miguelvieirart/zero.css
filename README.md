# zero.css
A small bootstrap based css-only framework created a few years ago for a few projects

# Purpose
To be a small framework for making websites, small in size and having lots of helpful functionalities,
It was created before the use of flex became widespread though, that's why it's based on inline-block elements.

- Feel free to use it on your projects and contribute to help it grow!
